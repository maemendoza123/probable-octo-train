  <h2>KAYANGAN LAKE</h2>
  <p>
     One of the most famous is Kayangan Lake in Coron. Surrounded by towering limestone cliffs dotted with greenery, Kayangan is the cleanest lake in the Philippines and one of the cleanest in Asia. The water is so clear that you can see through to the rock formations beneath the surface. It is one of two lakes in Coron (out of 8 lakes) that are open to the public. The lake is 70% freshwater and 30% saltwater, making it ideal for swimming.

  <h2>RACUH A PAYAMAN</h2>
  <p>
    If we’re to describe Racuh A Payaman in Batanes in one word, it’d be magical. There are rolling hills and knolls everywhere, surrounded by a carpet of the greenest grass you’ll ever see, that you’ll notice even the tiniest grass is swaying as Batanes wind blows. From there, you can also see Mt. Iraya, Diura Beach, Tayid Lighthouse, and the Pacific Ocean. All in one place. Racuh A Payaman is one of the top tourist spots in Luzon.

  <h2>INTRAMUROS</h2>
  <p>
   Known as the “Walled City,” Intramuros is a place rich in history and culture. With its cobbled streets and preserved architecture dated hundreds of years ago, it will have you thinking whether you are still in the Philippines or not. Hundreds of years ago, many remarkable events happened here that’s why it’s one of the most historical places in Luzon and in the Philippines.

  <h2>VIGAN</h2>
  <p>
    If you fancy exploring historical places in Luzon, Vigan should be on your list. Visiting Vigan City is like traveling back in time because of its preserved Spanish Colonial town that even the world considers it as one of the best. Aside from the magnificent Vigan tourist spots, what makes this North Luzon tourist spot well-loved is its historical and cultural significance that feed not just wanderlust but also a traveler’s mind and soul.

  <h2>NACPAN BEACH</h2>
  <p>
   Nacpan Beach in El Nido, Palawan is one of the most beautiful beautiful places in Luzon and among the pristine beaches in the Philippines. While it does not have the white sand that Boracay takes pride in, Nacpan Beach offers an equally notable island experience. Aside from the 4-kilometer stretch of cream-colored sand, you’ll also enjoy the hundreds of swaying coconut trees, a fishing village, clear aqua water with small surfable waves of Nacpan Beach—it’s the kind of paradise you’ve imagined.
